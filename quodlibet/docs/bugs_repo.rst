|bug-logo| Bug Tracker
----------------------

We use the GitHub bug tracker:

* Create a new issue: https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/issues/new


.. _gitrepo:

|github-logo| Git Repo
----------------------

Quod Libet uses `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ for source
control and is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ as well
as `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`__:

 * https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet (primary)
 * https://bitbucket.org/lazka/quodlibet (mirror)

.. _RunFromSource:

**Running from Source** (no installation is needed) **:**

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet.git
    $ ./quodlibet/quodlibet/quodlibet.py

To get all the dependencies needed for running Quod Libet the easiest way is 
to use one of the unstable PPAs / repos listed on the :ref:`download page 
<Downloads>`. They pull in or contain all the needed dependencies for the 
latest code and are kept up to date.
