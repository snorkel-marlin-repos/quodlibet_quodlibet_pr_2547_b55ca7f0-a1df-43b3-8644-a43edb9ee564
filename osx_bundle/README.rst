=========================
OS X Bundle Build Scripts
=========================

**Note:**
    In case you want just want to run Quod Libet from source you can ignore
    all this and use the released bundle as a development environment.
    Download the official bundle, git clone the quodlibet repo and do
    ``./QuodLibet.app/Contents/MacOS/run quodlibet.py``.


Uses jhbuild [2] and the stable module set provided by gtk-osx [1] with a Quod
Libet specific module set overlay to build all needed dependencies for Quod
Libet. Everything will be downloaded/installed into this directory and your
user directory will not be touched.


Creating a Bundle
-----------------

Prerequisites: `OS X` 10.7+ and a working `Xcode` [0]

Verify that Xcode and git is installed and in your ``$PATH`` by invoking ``git
--version`` and ``gcc --version``. Also make sure that other package managers
like homebrew or macports aren't in your ``$PATH``.

(Tested on OS X 10.9)

1) Call ``bootstrap.sh`` to install jhbuild and set up dummy ``$HOME`` as base.
2) Call ``build.sh`` to download and build all the dependencies.
   This should not lead to errors; if it does please file a bug.
3) Call ``bundle.sh`` to create the finished bundles for QL and EF in
   ``_build``.

Call ``clean.sh`` to remove everything created above again and get back to
the initial state.


Development
-----------

* After ``bootstrap.sh`` has finished executing ``source env.sh`` will put you
  in the build environment. After that jhbuild can be used directly (Enter the
  jhbuild environment using ``jhbuild shell``) or the Quod Libet test suite
  can be executed.
* ``bootstrap.sh`` can be called again to update the build environment while
  keeping any build packages.


Maintenance
-----------

* ``fetch_modules()`` downloads the git master of the gtk-osx module set
  and replaces the modules under "modulessets" and the
  ``misc/gtk-osx-jhbuildrc`` file. Doing so so should ideally be followed by a
  review of the quodlibet module to reduce duplication and a rebuilt to verify
  that everything still works.


Content Description
-------------------

* ``modulesets`` contains the gtk-osx stable module set and a quodlibet module
  which adds new packages replaces existing ones.
* ``misc``: see each file or directory README for a description.
